<p>George is the son of Frank Costanza and Estelle Contanza. George has mentioned
    having a brother a few times on the show though he has never been
    seen or even given a name.
    <img src="George.jpg" alt="George">George often grew up with his parents
having screaming matches with each other, and frequently criticizing
    George by complaining about how he wasn't like Lloyd Braun, a
    neighborhood kid his parents adored. George often claims that his
    difficult childhood was the cause of most of his neurotic tendencies. George has
    mentioned growing up in Brooklyn, New York and attended public school. He
    attended John F. Kennedy High School on Long Island and was in the class of
    1971. He met Jerry Seinfeld in gym class, and they have been best friends ever
    since (although he was jealous of Jerry's summer camp friend 'Fragile' Frankie
    Merman whom he referred to as the 'Summer Me'). He was also picked on in gym
    class by the gym teacher Mr. Heyman, whom George tattled on for giving him a
    wedgie and subsequently got Mr. Heyman fired. George and Jerry also
    frequently hung out at a restaurant called Mario's Pizza, where George got the
    high score on a Frogger game. George refers to this as the greatest
    accomplishment of his life. It has been mentioned that Jerry and George
    both attended Queens College. George's success there was somewhat
    debatable, as he mentions being a college graduate but his difficulty finding
    work and Diane DeConn, a former classmate of Jerry and George, claimed he
    was always goofing off and is never mentioned in the alumni magazine of the
    college. Jerry also told Elaine that George had gotten accepted to podiatry
    school, but nothing ever came of it.
